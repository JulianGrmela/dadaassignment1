<div class="intro">
    <p>Despite widespread parental support for a remote option, all New York City public-school students are required to attend in-person school this year. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Department of Education insist students are better off inside schools.</p>

<p>But in the months –– especially the last weeks –– leading up to the start of the school year, more and more families spoke out about their wish for a remote option, holding two rallies over the last weekend of summer vacation. Their reasons are diverse and complex, but many parents say they’re worried about covid safety.</p> 

<p>Some politicians, like Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and the City Council’s Education Committee Chair Mark Treyger, joined parents in their call for a remote option. So did the United Federation of Teachers.</p>

<p>As of October 13, there have been 4,713 positive cases identified in schools with 3,455 student cases and 1,258 staff cases since the start of the school year. There have been 1,554 classroom closures.</p>

<p>As the school year continues into its second month, community members are still speaking out. Some are participating in a school strike by keeping their children at home.</p> 

<p>Here are some common reasons parents want a remote option.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">

<h2>Low Vaccination Rates Amongst Students</h2>

<div class="text">
<p>Parents are worried about school transmission due to low vaccination rates among students and the postponement of the vaccine mandate for school employees. Vaccines are still unavailable to students under the age of 12, which make up over half of the student population. The DOE has not released vaccination rates amongst its eligible student population, but claims at least 74% of NYC residents between the ages of 12 and 17 received their first dose, according to Chalkbeat.</p></div>

<h2>Vaccine Mandate for DOE Employees</h2>
<div class="icons">

</div>
<div class="text">
<p>The Department of Education’s vaccine mandate just took effect last Monday, almost a week late. The vaccine mandate means all employees had to submit proof that they had at least one shot or they were put on unpaid leave. But the mandate didn’t take effect until the fourth week of school, so DOE employees were free to be unvaccinated in class until then. By the time the mandate did take effect, 95% of DOE employees submitted proof of their first shot. The unvaccinated 5% were put on unpaid leave. Some argue a remote option would provide some unvaccinated employees a way to keep their jobs without jeopardizing the safety of their students and colleagues.</p></div>

<h2>Inadequate Covid Testing Program</h2>
<div class="icons">
<img src="photos/covidtesting.png" alt="Low participation rates skew results."
height=30%

</div>
<div class="text">
<p>Less than a quarter of total NYC public school students have consented to the school system’s opt-in covid testing program, which aims to test 10% of unvaccinated students every week. Vaccinated students, along with students in Pre-K and 3-K, are not eligible for the testing program. But only 35% of eligible students have consented. There is no penalty for not enrolling kids in the opt-in testing program. Some worry the low participation rates will skew the test's results, making them less accurate than if more students participated.</p></div>

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <div class="icons">

    height=30%
    width=30%>
</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>Some parents think remote school is more accessible for their kids. Due to certain disabilities, some kids are not able to fully participate in in-person school activities. 20.2% of NYC public school students are disabled, according to data from the 2018/2019 school year reported by the Common Council. Parents of students with certain disabilities were pleasantly surprised when remote learning became available during the pandemic because it allowed theier children to participate in more activities at school than they had been able to before. Some parents say that regardless of the pandemic, remote learning should be an ongoing option to expand education accessability.</p></div>
